Pitfall
-first thing they see must tell the user the point of infographic
-have the correct colour combination
-dont overcrowd, less is better
-outofdate or irrelevantdata or incorrect data should be avoided
-infographic should have a story-path of information
-credit sources
-image should match the text.
